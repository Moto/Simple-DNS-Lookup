# Simple-DNS-Lookup
PHP DNS Lookup script

This project is my first creation on GitHub. I have created myself this tools for my need because I like host tools myself.

It's my first script, don't hesitate to complete it and make it much better.

Main modification to do are : Regex for domain, case where there is no domain.

You can test the tool here : https://outils.hqweb.com/dns-lookup/

Build on Bootstrap.
