## PHP DNS Lookup script

This is a simple PHP script that allows users to look up DNS records for a given domain. The script fetches A, AAAA, NS, MX, CNAME, SOA, TXT, CAA, ANY, HINFO, PTR, SRV, NAPTR, A6 records using PHP's built-in `dns_get_record()` function and displays the results in a user-friendly format. Built via Bootstrap.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Upload the files to your web server.
3. Access the script via a web browser by navigating to its URL.
4. Enter a domain name in the input field and click on the "Lookup" button to retrieve DNS records.
